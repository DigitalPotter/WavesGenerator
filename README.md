# Warning
This plugin doesn't provide any mesh quadtree/LOD system. You have to use your own, or take advantage of other plugins like Voxel Plugin or Worldscape. Meshes that are used in the example scenes were just subdivided to achieve the desirable level of detail.
# Planned
- Buoyancy
- Planet gravity using Unreal's native movement component
- Subsurface scattering
- Better foam masking and fading out
- Playable character
- Drivable boat
- (Possibly) CPU async or shader based mesh LOD system
# Content
